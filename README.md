# How to integrate Watsonx Governance for Efficient Traditional Predictive Models
 ![](assets/gover.jpg)
As Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have become the center of attention in the artificial intelligence conversation, many organizations are still working on integrating traditional predictive models into their operations. These endeavors are often hindered by increasing regulations and public scrutiny, leading to a lesser focus on predictive machine learning models compared to their generative counterparts. Despite this, there remains a significant opportunity to assist clients in addressing various use cases with predictive models.

This project aims to explore a predictive model for assessing the risk associated with auto insurance policies, taking into account different factors about the policyholder. Throughout the project, we will follow the model's lifecycle from its development phase to the testing and deployment stages. Additionally, we will set up the model for monitoring and examine how the evaluations are conducted and documented using the watsonx.governance platform. This hands-on approach will provide valuable insights into the integration and management of predictive models in the context of auto insurance risk prediction and regulatory compliance.

## Define a Model Use Case

We  will create a use case for a predictive risk model in the model inventory. Let's consider an insurance company that wants to assess the risk associated with auto insurance policies. The company's data science team has gathered data on accident "hotspots" in metro Chicago, where traffic accidents happen more frequently. They have found that policyholders who live closer to these hotspots are more likely to be involved in an accident and file a claim. The team wants to incorporate this data along with other risk factors such as driver age, gender, and vehicle type to build an AI risk prediction model.

To create a use case for the policy evaluation model, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to IBM Watsonx using the appropriate link for your region.
2. We go to Resources List and we Launch Watsonx.Governance

![](assets/2024-03-29-10-14-15.png)
### 6. Explain a prediction

AI models are not only required to meet standards for quality and fairness, but they also need to provide explanations for the decisions or predictions they make. 

To generate detailed explanations for predictive models, Watsonx.governance offers an explainability service. When configuring the explainability service, you can specify the algorithm to be used. From the table of transactions, you can click on one of the "Explain prediction" links. For more interesting results, try to find a prediction that is close to the threshold for an unfavorable outcome, which is set at 39 when configuring the fairness monitor.

The explainability service will use the LIME algorithm to generate a detailed explanation, but please note that this process may take a few minutes to complete. Once the explanation is generated, you can scroll down to the graph that depicts the influence different features had on the model's outcome. In the graph, features displayed in blue indicate an increase in the final score, while features in red indicate a decrease.

From the table of transactions, click one of the Explain prediction links.
![](assets/2024-03-29-10-17-29.png)

![](assets/2024-03-29-10-18-46.png)

For classification models, blue features signify a positive contribution to the model's confidence in the prediction, while red features indicate a decrease in confidence. It's important to remember that your explanation may differ from the provided screenshot, as it depends on the specific contributors to the risk score assigned. You can hover your cursor over the individual columns of the graph for more information.

To further explore the model's behavior, you can click on the "Inspect" tab. Here, you have the ability to alter values associated with a record and re-submit it to the model. This allows you to see how the final risk calculation changes based on different inputs. It can be particularly useful for gaining insights into the model's functioning or for policyholders seeking ways to decrease their risk assessment.

 Here, you can see the evaluation metrics generated by the monitoring tool. These metrics are automatically stored on the model's factsheet, providing stakeholders such as risk managers and data scientists with access to the information they need to assess model performance. If further information is required, there is an optional link provided that will open the monitoring tool.

## Conclusion, 

AI models should not only meet quality and fairness standards but also provide explanations for their predictions. By using tools like Watsonx.governance, you can generate detailed explanations for your predictive models, assess their performance, and make necessary adjustments. This ensures a transparent and reliable AI system that respects users' rights and complies with regulations.
